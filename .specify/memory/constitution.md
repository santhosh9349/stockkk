# Alpha-Agent 2026 Constitution
<!-- Governing principles for the Alpha-Agent 2026 Investment System -->

## Core Principles

### I. Financial Integrity
<!-- Non-negotiable entry/exit criteria -->
No trade recommendation is valid without a calculated Entry, Target, and a mandatory 2.5% Trailing Stop-Loss.

### II. Data Governance
<!-- Quality over quantity -->
Prioritize data from verified MCP servers (Alpha Vantage, FRED, Bloomberg) over general web-search sentiment to prevent 'noise' interference.

### III. Risk Management
<!-- Capital preservation rules -->
- **Biotech**: Minimum market cap of $500M to avoid 'pump and dump' micro-caps.
- **Portfolio**: Any stock in existing portfolio showing a -5% trend against the 20-day SMA must trigger an immediate 'Exit' or 'Hedge' alert.

### IV. Macro Correlation
<!-- Context determination -->
Metals (Gold/Silver) advice must always be weighted against the current DXY (Dollar Index) trend and 10-year Treasury yields.

### V. Operational Window
<!-- SLA for insights -->
All scans must complete and reports must be delivered by 08:30 AM EST to allow for pre-market review.

## Governance
<!-- Compliance and Amendment Policy -->

All code, algorithms, and trade logic must strictly adhere to these principles. Amendments require documented justification and backtesting validation ensuring no degradation of the Alpha factor or violation of risk limits.
